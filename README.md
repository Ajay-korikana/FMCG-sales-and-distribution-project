 Revenue Analysis
Category Contribution

Cigarettes contribute 36.5% of total revenue.

Biscuits (24.2%) and Bingo (15.1%) form the secondary revenue layer.

Top 3 categories together generate 75.8% of overall sales, indicating strong revenue concentration.

Business Interpretation

Inventory and supply continuity for top categories is business-critical.

Portfolio risk exists due to category dependency.

Monthly Sales Trend

Key Findings:

Revenue shows clear seasonality.

March recorded lowest performance (~₹55L).

Strong acceleration observed in H2.

December achieved peak sales (~₹1.21 Cr).

Festive season significantly influences demand cycles.

Business Interpretation

Demand forecasting should incorporate seasonal uplift factors.

Inventory buildup required before Q3–Q4.

Multivariate Analysis
Correlation Observations

| Relationship                | Observation                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Gross Amount ↔ Total Amount | Near-perfect correlation      |
| Taxable Value ↔ Tax         | Strong positive relationship  |
| Quantity ↔ Revenue          | Moderate positive correlation |
| Discount ↔ Revenue          | Negative influence            |
| Unit Price ↔ Quantity       | Slight inverse relationship   |




Interpretation

Revenue primarily volume-driven.

Pricing sensitivity exists for higher-value products.

Financial calculations internally consistent.

 KPI Framework (Dashboard Design)

Proposed analytical KPIs:

Total Revenue

Total Invoices

Active Customers

Average Invoice Value

Revenue by Category
